# Atomic Giveaway

A hybrid variant of Atomic and Giveaway Chess (Antichess). Players win by
stalemating themselves or by reducing their piece count to one. In the case of
a move that reduces the player-to-move to one piece but also stalemates the
opponent, reducing the piece count to one takes precedence and thus a win for
the player reduced to one piece on their turn. There is no castling.
