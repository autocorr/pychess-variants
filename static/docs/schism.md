# Schism

Schism is a prototype asymmetric New Army variant designed by Couch Tomato. Play takes place in the early European Middle Ages where the Holy Roman Empire faces-off against the Byzantine Roman Empire after the East-West Schism. The HRE play Black using the standard Chess army and the Byzantines play White using a new army.

A thorough description of the piece movements is forth-coming. Note that there is no win by campmate, the Byzantines cannot castle, and that the Byzantine pieces only promote when capturing a piece (the three Pawn types and Trebuchet) and such promotion can occur on any square.
