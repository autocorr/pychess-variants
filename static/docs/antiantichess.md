# Anti-antichess
Lose in Antichess to win in Anti-antichess. Similar to Antichess, Kings lose their royal powers, pawns can promote to Kings, there is no castling, and captures are mandatory. Unlike Antichess, stalemate is a loss for the stalemated player and you win if you capture all of your opponent's pieces (i.e., you lose if you lose all of your own).
