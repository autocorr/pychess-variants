# Epic Atomic

An Atomic variant played on a 10 by 8 board originally playable on the LiAtomic website. In this modified version, all of the rules of Atomic apply except (1) castling is allowed on the Kingside to the Kingside on the ninth file and Queenside to the third file, (2) Pawns may promote only to Bishops, and (3) unlike the LiAtomic version Pawns may only promote on the final rank.
