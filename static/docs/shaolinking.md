# Shaolin King

All the rules of standard Chess apply except that (1) the King is replaced with
the Shaolin Master whose move is described below, (2) the game is won if a Pawn
reaches the final rank ("Pawn mate"), and (3) stalemate is a loss for the
stalemated player.  The Shaolin Master flips between alternate forms when
moved. The first move one space to the left or right as well as a capture-only
move as a Queen. The second form moves and captures as the Quetzal in Chak,
i.e., may travel over any number of free spaces and hop over a piece to capture
or land on the any number of free spaces on the other side. Note that without a
hurdle the King is otherwise immobile.
