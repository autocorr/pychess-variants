# Shaolin King

All the rules of standard Chess apply except that (1) the King is replaced with
the Shaolin Master whose move is described below, (2) the game is won if a Pawn
reaches the final rank ("Pawn mate"), and (3) stalemate is a loss for the
stalemated player.  The Shaolin Master flips between alternate forms when
moved. The first is the standard Chess King move. The second form may capture
as a Queen but may not move passively (i.e., is immobile).
