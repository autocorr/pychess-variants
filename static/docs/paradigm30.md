# Paradigm Chess 30

Paradigm was invented in 2020 by Lourenzo van Niekerk and Craig Willenberg. The rules of standard Chess apply except that (1) the Bishop has the added move of a Horse from Xiangqi ("Dragon Bishops") and (2) the starting position is randomized among 30 positions that keep the King and Rooks on their starting files. Complete rules can be found on the Chess Variant [Pages](https://www.chessvariants.com/rules/paradigm-chess30).
